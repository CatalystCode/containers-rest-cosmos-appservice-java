## FAQ

### What browser does this use to simulate user interaction?

We use [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer), which in turn uses Chrome.

### What values do I use for the base URL properties?

If you're running our service on Azure and are using Application Gateway to front the traffic (as is default) you can point `backendBaseUrl` at `http://<yourAppGatewayIp>` or `http://<yourConfiguredDnsName>`, and `frontendBaseUrl` at `http://<yourAppGatewayIp>/ui` or `http://yourConfiguredDnsName>/ui`.

### How can I generate an AAD account?

If you're using AAD internal user accounts, you can create a new one following along with [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory). If you're using AAD public Microsoft accounts, you can create a new a new outlook account [here](https://outlook.com).

### How can I determine which type of AAD account I need to use?

This is in reference to [the above question](#how-can-i-generate-an-aad-account) - To determine which account type you are using you can inspect your AAD application's manifest. If your manifest contains `signInAudience: AzureADAndPersonalMicrosoftAccount` then it supports public Microsoft accounts. If it does not, then you support only AAD internal user accounts. For reference, see [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest).
